Whenever diagnosing why a user is not able to login:
1. Check if user is active or not
2.  you can go to users -> Login History -> Check the cause 
3. If you dont see anything there maybe he is putting in wrong username (Ask the user to replicate it while sharing screen)


Agar koi hierachy me upar bhi ho aur uske pass ek object ke read access nahi hai toh usko kisi bhi case me uske neeche vali hierarchy me bane hue record nahi dikhenge

Sharing rules set up in Sirion for Opportunity are based on Global Region and owner based

While configuring dashboard, if data coming incorrect, login from user and check if data actually exists or no because sometimes the report is wrong and they are not the owner, in my case in a quota dashboard data was not coming correctly so check by logging in as user if they are not the owner, they were the sales user and report was running with the filter:
Show Me:
My Quotas
but the owner was abrar ali


Whenever testing dashboard or Report, always login as user and check records opening their reports for better clarity








IF(

  Account.AnnualRevenue / CURRENCYRATE(TEXT(Account.CurrencyIsoCode)) >= 500000000,

  'Enterprise',

  IF(

    Account.AnnualRevenue / CURRENCYRATE(TEXT(Account.CurrencyIsoCode)) < 500000000,

    'Commercial',

    ''

  )
